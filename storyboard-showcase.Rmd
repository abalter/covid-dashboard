### Including Plots, sometimes they have interesting data and other times its this weird graph

```{r}
p <- plot_ly(midwest, x = ~percollege, color = ~state, type = "box")
p
```

- This is a fun example of a graph for which I do not know what the data means

### Plotly will not give you a virus if you click it, I swear
    
```{r}
library(plotly)
p <- ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = cut, fill = clarity)) +
            geom_bar(position = "dodge")
ggplotly(p)
```

- This is a fun example of a graph for which I do not know what the data means
- This one is interactive and I think that is cool
